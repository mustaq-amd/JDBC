CAP Theorem
-------------

CAP stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. 

The theorem states that a distributed system cannot guarantee all three (consistency, availability, and partition tolerance) all the time.
When things go wrong, needs to prioritize at most two characteristics of distributed systems to keep.

Consistency
------------

Consistency means all the nodes will have consistent data which means same data will be replicate dto all the node

Availability
-------------
Availability means that each request gives an appropriate response. High availability systems achieve responsiveness through replication.
They duplicate data across multiple nodes so they are available to take read or write requests.

Availabile system makes no consistency guarantee. It guarantee that all the requests will be processed but not the latest data will be fetched.

Partition tolerance
-------------------

Partition tolerance refers to the ability of a distributed system to perform normally at the time of network failures.
A network partition is the technical term of a network failure - the entire network is partitioned into subnetworks because one or two
nodes lost communication between them.
The partition tolerance guarantee promises that users sending  requests to the system will not be affected by network partitions.
From an external user view, the system will behave as if no single node has failed.

Scenario :-
---------

When an application has an huge data, If the data is growing very largely day by day. where an application does not need consistency of data but
data availability is preferreable then we go for CAP theorem.
