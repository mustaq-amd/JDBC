Operating System
------------------

Operating System is an interface between a user and system hardware.

Example : Windows, MacOS, Unix

Features
--------
-> Memory Management
-> Processor Management
-> Device Management
-> File Management
-> Security
-> System Performance
-> Process Scheduling

Memory Management
------------------

It refers to the management of Primary memory or Main Memory. Any program to be executed it must be in main memory.
Operating System keeps track of primary memory. It allocates and de-allocates memory to the processes when they need and and no longer needs
respectively.

Processor Management
---------------------

In Multi-Threading OS decides which process get the Processor and for how much time.
It keeps track of processor and the status of the process. It allocates and de-allocates processor to the process.

Device management
------------------

OS manages device communication via their respective drivers.
It keeps tracks of all the devices. It decides which process gets the device and for how much time. It allocates and de-allocates device
in efficient way.

File Management
----------------

Os take care of file management in the form of directories and organize them for easy navigation and usage.
It keeps track of information, location, user, status etc. The collective facilities are  known as file system.
It allocates and de-allocates the resources.

Security
--------
It gives an security layer in the form of access the system through password. It prevents unauthorized access to the system.

Process Scheduling
-------------------
It keeps track of time  and resources used by various jobs and users.
